# SCSS The 7-1 Pattern
 + Use this file architecture for your Front-End projects
 + You can read more about the official pattern from [here](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern)

## Abstracts
 + The `abstracts` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project
 + Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here

## Base
 + The `base` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. 
 + In there, you might find the reset file, some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements
